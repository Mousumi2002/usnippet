I wrote it just for fun. (The facts provided are true though. I just tried to tell it in a different fashion)

## Who am I?

Yeah, It's normal to ask that. Who the heck I am...
Let me clarify that, I'm an Indian, school going kid who ~~nails~~ fails in maths.
Yep! I'm serious.  I just ~~nailed~~ failed it.
(But, don't judge me with that :worried: )

## I have potato pc. Will it hang?

Well, it shouldn't.


## How many digits it can count?

I don't know honestly. But, think in million(s).
